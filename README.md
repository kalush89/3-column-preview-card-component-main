## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Wish to focus on the following concepts in the future

- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Centering things](https://www.better.dev/centering-things-with-css-flexbox) - This helped me center the proect on the page. I really liked this solution and will use it going forward.
- [Learn CSS Flexbox](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Fexbox layouts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
